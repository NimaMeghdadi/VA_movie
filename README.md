# Movie Virtual Assistant

## Description
The Movie Virtual Assistant provides movie information in a chatbot environment, allowing users to retrieve details about films directly without needing to search manually. It integrates with the OMDb dataset, utilizing various APIs to fetch information about movies, including details on directors, release dates, genres, ratings, and more.

## Features
- **Movie Detection**: Identifies movie names from user input using `movie-roberta-MITmovie-squad` and Gemini for natural language processing (NLP).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Recognizes entities like movie titles, directors, and genres in user requests.
- **Intent Detection**: Detects user intent based on keywords, such as release year or director, using predefined intent mappings for efficient querying.

## Installation
To set up the Movie Virtual Assistant:

1. Install the required dependencies by following the commands in `requirements.txt`, updating Google Generative AI, and downloading the English language model for SpaCy.

2. Obtain and set up API keys from the following providers:
   - OMDb API
   - Gemini
   - Hugging Face

3. Replace these keys in `config.py` to enable API access.

## Configuration
Add your API keys in the `config.py` file:
```python
# config.py
OMDB_API_KEY = 'your_omdb_api_key'
GEMINI_API_KEY = 'your_gemini_api_key'
HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY = 'your_hugging_face_api_key'
```

## Usage Examples
Sample interaction with the assistant:
- **User**: "Who directed Dune?"
- **Assistant**: "Dune (2021) was directed by Denis Villeneuve."

### Sample OMDb API Response
A typical response from the OMDb API might include:
```json
{
  "Title": "Dune",
  "Year": "2021",
  "Rated": "PG-13",
  "Released": "22 Oct 2021",
  "Genre": "Action, Adventure, Drama",
